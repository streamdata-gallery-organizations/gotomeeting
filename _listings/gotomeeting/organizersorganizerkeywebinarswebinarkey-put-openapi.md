      summary: Create webinar
      description: 'Creates a single session webinar, a sequence of webinars or a
        series of webinars depending on the type field in the body: "single_session"
        creates a single webinar session, "sequence" creates a webinar with multiple
        meeting times where attendees are expected to be the same for all sessions,
        and "series" creates a webinar with multiple meetings times where attendees
        choose only one to attend. The default, if no type is declared, is single_session.
        A sequence webinar requires a "recurrenceStart" object consisting of a "startTime"
        and "endTime" key for the first webinar of the sequence, a "recurrencePattern"
        of "daily", "weekly", "monthly", and a "recurrenceEnd" which is the last date
        of the sequence (for example, 2016-12-01). A series webinar requires a "times"
        array with a discrete "startTime" and "endTime" for each webinar in the series.
        The call requires a webinar subject and description. The "isPasswordProtected"
        sets whether the webinar requires a password for attendees to join. If set
        to True, the organizer must go to Registration Settings at My Webinars (https://global.gotowebinar.com/webinars.tmpl)
        and add the password to the webinar, and send the password to the registrants.
        The response provides a numeric webinarKey in string format for the new webinar.
        Once a webinar has been created with this method, you can accept registrations.'
